A (hopefully) well-structured and easy to understand Jupyter notebook outlining some machine-learning basics with the help of a self-written adjustable *neural network* using purely the power of the brilliant [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) module. I originally decided against using any mainstream machine-learning modules such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), etc. in order to acquire a *deeper understanding* about the mathematics and tech behind deep neural networks.
